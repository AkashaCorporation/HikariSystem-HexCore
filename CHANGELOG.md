# Changelog

All notable changes to the HikariSystem HexCore project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.5.3] - 2026-02-18 - "Quality & Polish"

> **Maintenance Release** — Developer experience improvements, Issue #8 resolution, and documentation overhaul.

### Fixed

- **Preinstall robustness** — `build/npm/preinstall.ts` `installHeaders()` now uses `--ignore-scripts` flag, 60-second timeout, and clear error messages when `npm ci` fails in `build/npm/gyp/`. Prevents the interactive shell hang reported in Issue #8.
- **Report Composer outDir resolution** — `composeReport` now resolves the reports directory from: (1) explicit `reportsDir` argument, (2) `output.path` parent directory (pipeline outDir), (3) default `hexcore-reports/`. Previously it was hardcoded to `hexcore-reports/` which failed when the pipeline used a custom `outDir`.

### Added

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Complete contributor guide with prerequisites, quick start, project structure, test instructions, extension creation guide, code style reference, native engine development notes, and PR process.

### Improved

- **DEVELOPMENT.md** — Added "Important Notes" section at top with `VSCODE_SKIP_NODE_VERSION_CHECK` requirement, prebuild auto-download clarification, and preinstall troubleshooting.

### Issue #8 Resolution

All 5 items from @YasminePayload's build process report are now resolved. Full credit to **@YasminePayload** for the incredibly detailed bug report that directly improved HexCore's build system reliability and developer experience.

| Item | Description | Fixed In |

| #1 | Interactive shell blocks npm install | v3.5.3 |
| #2 | Native module binary naming mismatch | v3.4.2 |
| #3 | Missing build/Release directory | v3.4.2 |
| #4 | Unicorn DLL multi-location requirement | v3.4.2 |
| #5 | No development build documentation | v3.5.3 |
| #6 | Debugger extension crash | v3.5.1 |

## [3.5.2] - 2026-02-17 - "Pipeline Maturity"

> **Feature Release** — Full pipeline maturity: every analytical capability in HexCore is now accessible programmatically. New ELF Analyzer, Report Composer, multi-byte XOR deobfuscation, and headless commands for Debugger, Base64, and Hex Viewer.

### Added

- **Debugger Headless — Snapshot & Restore** — `hexcore.debug.snapshotHeadless` and `hexcore.debug.restoreSnapshotHeadless` commands for pipeline-driven emulation state management.
- **API/Lib Call Trace** — `TraceManager` captures API/libc calls with arguments, return values, and PC addresses during emulation. New `TraceTreeProvider` panel for real-time visualization. `hexcore.debug.exportTraceHeadless` for pipeline export.
- **ELF Analyzer** (`hexcore-elfanalyzer`) — New extension for structural analysis of ELF binaries. TypeScript-pure parser supporting ELF32/ELF64, section/segment/symbol parsing, dynamic linking info, and security mitigations (RELRO, Stack Canary, NX, PIE). Commands: `hexcore.elfanalyzer.analyze`, `hexcore.elfanalyzer.analyzeActive`.
- **Report Composer** (`hexcore-report-composer`) — New extension that aggregates pipeline outputs from `hexcore-reports/` directory into a unified Markdown report with table of contents, evidence links, and analyst notes. Command: `hexcore.pipeline.composeReport`.
- **Base64 Headless** — `hexcore.base64.decodeHeadless` command for pipeline-driven Base64 string extraction from binary files.
- **Multi-byte XOR Deobfuscation** — Extended `hexcore.strings.extractAdvanced` with multi-byte XOR keys (2, 4, 8, 16 bytes), rolling XOR, and XOR with increment detection. Frequency analysis-based key recovery.
- **Hex Viewer Headless** — `hexcore.hexview.dumpHeadless` for programmatic hex dump extraction and `hexcore.hexview.searchHeadless` for pattern search with streaming (64KB chunks + overlap).
- **Pipeline Capability Registration** — All 9 new headless commands registered in `COMMAND_CAPABILITIES`, `COMMAND_OWNERS`, and `COMMAND_ALIASES` maps. 3 convenience aliases added.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-02-16 - "ARM64 Fix"

> **Bugfix Release** — Complete ARM/ARM64 support across disassembler, debugger, strings, and formula engines. Previously, ARM64 binaries were effectively unreadable. Tested against HTB Insane-level ARM64 ELF: 72 functions discovered (was 1).

### Fixed

- **Capstone ARM64 instruction classification** — `isCall`, `isRet`, `isJump`, `isConditional` flags now correctly detect ARM64 branch instructions: `blr`/`blraa`/`blrab`, `bx lr`/`retaa`/`retab`/`pop {pc}`, dot-notation (`b.eq`, `b.ne`), `cbz`/`cbnz`/`tbz`/`tbnz`, `br`, and ARM32 conditional branches (`beq`, `bne`, `bhi`, etc.).
- **STP x29,x30 encoding mask** — prolog scanner mask was `0xFFFF83FF` (included imm7 bits), changed to `0xFC407FFF` to match any addressing mode and offset.
- **Trampoline/thunk following** — `analyzeFunction` now follows unconditional jump targets as new functions (entry point trampolines like `b #target` were previously dead-ends).
- **Race condition in recursive analysis** — `analyzeFunction` fired off child BL target analysis without `await`, causing floating promises. Functions discovered via calls were missing from reports. Now properly awaits all child targets before returning.

### Added

- **ARM64/ARM32 function prolog scanning** — `scanForFunctionPrologs` detects STP x29,x30 (any addressing mode), SUB SP,SP, PACIASP (ARM64), PUSH {lr}/STR LR,[SP] (ARM32).
- **ARM64 function end detection** — architecture-aware: ARM64 NOP (`0xD503201F`), ARM32 NOP, UDF padding, and ARM prolog boundaries.
- **ARM64/ARM32 fallback disassembly** — `decodeARM64Fallback` (NOP, RET, BL, B, B.cond, CBZ/CBNZ, STP, LDP, BLR, BR) and `decodeARM32Fallback` (NOP, BX LR, POP {pc}, BL, B, PUSH).
- **ARM64 stack string detection** — `stackStringDetector` scans for STRB/STR opcodes with SP/FP base register, backward search for MOVZ loading ASCII values.
- **ARM64 DebugEngine** (5 methods):
  - `setupArm64Stack()` — LR=0xDEAD0000 sentinel, 16-byte SP alignment
  - `initializeElfProcessStack()` — argc/argv/envp via X0/X1/X2 (register-based)
  - `installSyscallHandler()` — SVC #0 interception (intno===2), X8=syscall number
  - `updateEmulationRegisters()` — x0-x15, fp, sp, pc, nzcv mapping
  - `popReturnAddress()` — reads LR (X30) instead of stack pop
  - 20+ ARM64 Linux syscalls: write(64), exit(93), exit_group(94), brk(214), mmap(222), openat(56), close(57), fstat(80), ioctl(29), readlinkat(78), etc.
- **ARM64 formulaBuilder** — register recognition (x0-x30, w0-w30, sp, lr, fp, xzr, wzr, pc, r0-r15), `#` prefix handling, 15 ARM mnemonics (movz, movk, movn, mul, madd, msub, neg, eor, orr, and, lsl, lsr, asr, mla, mvn), 3-operand instruction form support.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-15 - "Fortification"

> **Security & Stability Release** — Full codebase audit across all 18 HexCore extensions. CSP hardening, memory safety, input validation, and crash prevention.

### Security

- **CSP nonce-based script injection** — hexviewer and peanalyzer webviews now use `nonce-<random>` instead of `'unsafe-inline'` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **ReDoS prevention** — base64 scanner regex bounded to `{20,4096}` (was unbounded `{20,}`).
- **Output path validation** — hashcalc and filetype `output.path` restricted to workspace or user home directory, preventing arbitrary file writes.
- **File size limit** — disassembler engine rejects files >512MB before `readFileSync` to prevent OOM crashes.

### Fixed

- **Unicorn hook memory leaks** — replaced raw `new`/`delete` with `std::unique_ptr` RAII in 5 hook callback allocations (`unicorn_wrapper.cpp`).
- **Strings offset carryover bug** — fixed incorrect offset calculation in chunked extraction that caused reported offsets to drift.
- **Base64 streaming** — replaced `readFileSync` with chunked streaming (1MB chunks + 4KB overlap) to handle large files without loading entire file into memory.
- **Remill crash prevention** — added try/catch in C++ `DoLift` and `LiftBytesWorker::Execute` (was aborting process due to `NAPI_DISABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS`).
- **Remill semantics path resolution** — `GetModuleHandleA` now tries both `hexcore_remill.node` and `hexcore-remill.node` naming conventions.
- **Capstone ARM/ARM64 sync/async detail parity** — sync path now includes `mem`, `shift`, `vectorIndex`, `subtracted`, `ext`, `vas` fields matching async output.
- **Capstone error handling** — `numInsns == 0` with `CS_ERR_OK` is now treated as valid (empty input), added null guard on `cs_free`.

### Changed

- **Truncation warnings** — hexviewer search results (50 limit) and peanalyzer suspicious strings (20 limit) now show "Showing X of Y" when truncated.
- **Native module naming** — all 4 engines (Capstone, Remill, Unicorn, LLVM MC) now try both underscore and hyphen naming conventions for prebuilds.
- **`.vscodeignore` hardening** — added `!prebuilds/**` force-include to Capstone, Unicorn, LLVM MC, and better-sqlite3 to ensure prebuilds survive packaging.

### npm Packages Published

| Package | Version |
|---------|---------|
| hexcore-capstone | 1.3.2 |
| hexcore-remill | 0.1.1 |
| hexcore-unicorn | 1.2.0 |
| hexcore-llvm-mc | 1.0.0 |
| hexcore-better-sqlite3 | 2.0.0 |

## [3.4.1] - 2026-02-14

> **Fix Release** — hexcore-remill packaging fix: promoted from experimental to production engine in CI/CD pipeline.

### Fixed
- **hexcore-remill not included in packaged builds** — the native module worked in dev mode but was missing from the installer output. Added to `nativeExtensions` in build system.
- **Prebuild workflow** — moved hexcore-remill from experimental matrix to main prebuild matrix alongside Capstone, Unicorn, LLVM MC, and better-sqlite3.
- **Semantics packaging** — added dedicated semantics tarball (`remill-semantics-win32-x64.tar.gz`) to prebuild workflow for LLVM IR .bc files required at runtime.
- **Installer workflow** — added hexcore-remill prebuild fetch + semantics download for Windows and Linux builds.

### Changed
- Experimental prebuild matrix now only contains hexcore-rellic (future).
- Updated GitHub Actions versions in experimental job (v4 → v6).
- `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` — hexcore-remill moved from "Future Engines (Research)" to Infrastructure (#20).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-13 - "IR Horizon"

#### SKILL.md: Complete Technical API Documentation
- Full emulator memory layout with addresses (STUB_BASE, TEB, PEB, heap, stack, TLS)
- Complete DebugEngine, PE Loader, ELF Loader, Memory Manager API reference
- 25+ Windows API hooks table, 40+ Linux API hooks table, 12 syscall handlers
- Unicorn Wrapper API with all methods and types
- WebView message protocol and troubleshooting guides

### Changed
- `elfLoader.ts` completely rewritten with PIE support, PLT stub creation, and dual `.rela.plt`/`.rela.dyn` GOT patching
- `unicornWrapper.ts` overhauled with API redirect loop, state sync, and `EmulationState.isReady` field
- `debugEngine.ts` updated with ELF loading flow, TLS setup, stdin buffer, and state management
- `disassemblerEngine.ts` updated with inline PE/ELF parsing, function prolog scan, and string xrefs
- `capstoneWrapper.ts` improved with instruction type analysis (call/jump/ret/conditional detection)
- `llvmMcWrapper.ts` improved with multi-arch assembly support and NOP padding
- All analysis extensions refactored with consistent headless APIs

### Known Issues (Preview)
- Deep stepping (~400+ steps) may encounter `UC_ERR_FETCH_PROT` on some code paths
- File I/O hooks (`fopen`, `fread`, etc.) are stubs returning error codes
- No dynamic linker emulation (imports resolved statically via GOT patching)
- `.hexcore_job.json` is auto-generated by AI agents - not committed to repository

## [3.1.1] - 2026-02-03 - "Stability Pass"

### Added
- Native engine availability diagnostics for Disassembler and Debugger (Capstone/LLVM MC/Unicorn).
- Shared native module loader in `hexcore-common` with consistent error reporting.
- Postinstall native prebuild installer (`scripts/hexcore-native-install.js`) and Windows prebuild workflow.
- `engines.vscode` metadata for native engine packages to prevent extension host load errors.
- Function selector in the large disassembly editor for quick navigation.

### Fixed
- Disassembler PE analysis now passes file path (not buffer) and awaits results so Sections/Imports/Exports render.
- Large disassembly editor navigation now selects the containing function for a target address.
- Default function selection prefers entry point or first non-empty function instead of empty stubs.

### Changed
- Hardened native engine loading paths for Capstone/LLVM MC/Unicorn to improve portability.
